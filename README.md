It allows all team members to view upcoming events, select available time slots for meetings or activities, and track progress on assigned tasks within projects. The application is designed to streamline collaboration by keeping everyone updated on key dates, availability, and task completion.

## Why is this project of interest to me?
When working on group assignments, it's hard to find a good meeting time just by texting in a group chat, especially when someoneâ€™s schedule changes. It's also tough to keep track of the assignments' progress. I want to create a project that makes scheduling easier and helps keep track of group activities.
