## Why is this project of interest to me?
When working on group assignments, it's hard to find a good meeting time just by texting in a group chat, especially when someoneâ€™s schedule changes. It's also tough to keep track of the assignments' progress. I want to create a project that makes scheduling easier and helps keep track of group activities.
