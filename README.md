# Team Event and Task Manager

This application helps teams manage their events and projects efficiently. It allows all team members to view upcoming events and track progress on assigned tasks within projects. The application is designed to streamline collaboration by keeping everyone updated on key dates, availability, and task completion.

## Features
- **Event Management:** 
    - Add upcoming team events like meetings, birthday parties, or other events.
    - Team members can view all scheduled events.
    - Members can select available time slots, allowing the app to suggest the best time for most participants.   
- **Team Member Profiles:**
    - Record each team member's name, birthday, task, and additional information.
- **Project Task Assignment:**
    - Team leaders can assign tasks to members within a project.
    - All members can view project tasks and see the current progress (e.g., Task A is completed, Task B is in progress).


## Why is this project of interest to me?
When working on group assignments, it's hard to find a good meeting time just by texting in a group chat, especially when someoneâ€™s schedule changes. It's also tough to keep track of the assignments' progress. I want to create a project that makes scheduling easier and helps keep track of group activities.

## Phase 4: Task 3
To improve my design, I can replace the String status in Task with an enum (e.g., TaskStatus). This would improve type safety, prevent errors from invalid strings, and enhance code clarity.
